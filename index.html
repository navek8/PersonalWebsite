		This is the personal webpage of me, Kevan Mah. I'm using this website to brush up on basic web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and product design.

		My SourceCode can be found on <a href="https://github.com/navek8">GitHub</a>.
		<br>
		I'll try to include updates on here as progress is made.

		<h3>Sunday July 26th, 2015</h3>
		It's been a while since I've had a change to work on this but this is what I have done today:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Added in <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">bootstrap.css</a>. It's a pretty nice CSS framework that just seemed to make everything look nicer/easier. Seems to make the page load nicer in mobile as well. </li>
			<li>Started playing around with some containers to frame the page better, center the content so it fits on a 1280px wide resolution screen well. The containers seem to work great thus far.</li>
			<li>Started playing with a few style elements, made the font open-sans, playing with colors. I will try to start making the page look nicer soon.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Monday July 13th, 2015</h3>
		This is what I have done today:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Figured out how to create a fixed navbar in CSS. The tutorial I used is <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/css/fixed-navigation-bar/">here</a>.</li>
			<li>Next I want to figure out how to make a dropdown menu for the Projects menu item.</li>
			<li>Ok, so this was easy. I found a code example that I could borrow <a href="http://codepen.io/philhoyt/pen/ujHzd">here</a>. A little too easy. I had to combine the above examples so I could make the menu stay fixed to the top of the screen and play with the style of the menu items to get it to a fixed width and make it look a little better, but I'm happy with the functionality.</li>
			<li>I spoke a little too soon. I had a really hard time centering this on the top of the page. To solve, I had to make a menu div as a container, and center the nav menu inside that container. I tried doing it all in one step but that wasn't really working when I wanted to menu background to expand to 100% of the page width. It's still not perfect as the menu items are a variable width, and I had to give the nav menu a fixed widht of 500px which is about the sum of all the current menu items. This can be a little ugly if I decide to add/remove menu items and then have to reset that width. I'll try to clean this up to make the width of the nav a variable that is equal to the sum of its inherent elements.</li>
			<li>After adding that fixed header, it screwed up my anchor links on the page. I had to add a new anchor class to those anchors that offset the page by the height of my fixed nav bar (32px)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Sunday July 12th, 2015</h3>
		<p>
		This is what I have done today:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Setup and Amazon EC2 server with a basic LAMP setup (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</li>
			<li>Got the domain name (kevanmah.com) to point to the new EC2 server</li>
			<li>Setup GitHub repository using the Windows GitHub desktop client. One of these days I'll switch over to a mac or some *nix device and get more cozy with Git and command line stuff.</li>
			<li>Imported the <a href="weddingwebsite/">wedding website.</a>
			<li>Created this basic landing page by handwriting some html old-school. Next step, get fancy with some CSS and make this site look nice.
		</ul>
