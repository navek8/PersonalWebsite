			This is the personal webpage of me, Kevan Mah. I'm using this website to brush up on basic web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and product design. I don't have a lot of time to work on this, but I try to complete a manageable chunk every now and then when I have an hour or two to spare.
			<br>
			My SourceCode can be found on <a href="https://github.com/navek8">GitHub</a>.
			<br>
			I'll try to include updates on here as progress is made.

		<h3>Wednesday August 19th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>I started working on the resume section. Not a lot is done yet, but it's really helped my understanding of CSS absolute and relative position. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/absolute-positioning-inside-relative-positioning/">Here</a> is a super simple guide that helped me figure out how to make all my elements appear correctly in the container. I'll have to use this new knowledge to clean up how other things are laid out on the site.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Tuesday August 18th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>I added a simple <a href="#contact">contact form</a>. Originally I had planned on writing my own with a simple PHP form but my first iteration of that seemed so susceptible to spam and other junk. Rather than build out all the error checking and use cases, I found <a href="http://www.wufoo.com">these guys</a> who make forms very easy to use and simple to integrate. It was a little annoying to have to work through their theme builder and GUI to get the form to look the way I want, but I see they do have some advanced customization if you really want to get into that. In the end, I'm happy with how it looks.</a>.</li>
				<li>There is a bug in the form that makes the page refresh up to the top when you submit. I'll try to debug it in my next session.</li>

			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Wednesday August 12th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>I updated the projects section with a link to the <a href="weddingwebsite/">website I built for my wedding</a>.</li>
				<li>I found this <a href="http://geekgirllife.com/place-text-over-images-on-hover-without-javascript/">awesome tutorial</a> on how to make hover effects for the links to my various projects.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Thursday July 30th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>I didn't accompish much today. I did some quick bug fixes on how the image appears and then scaled down the image size from 1.6MB -> 262KB to help the page load faster. The image quality didn't need to be so high, especially since I have the grey CSS overlay on top of it.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Wednesday July 29th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>I put in a cool home background of the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. I had no idea how tricky backgrounds could be. I managed to get a cool features in there with some javascript that resizes it to the browser width/height but it's still not exactly how I want it. I can't believe how much time I spent getting a single picture to appear correctly. Hopefully this goes smoother for the next one! For others that are stuck, I used the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_jumbotron_header.asp">boot strap jumbotron</a> background image feature and some tips from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22000754/responsive-bootstrap-jumbotron-background-image">stackoverflow.</a> </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Tuesday July 28th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Had more fun with jQuery and bootstrap today. I updated the nav menu to make it fixed on the page in the top right and implemented ScrollSpy so that the navbar highlights/follows you around. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_scrollspy.asp">This</a> is a great tutorial for anyone else interested in it.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Monday July 27th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Started playing around with <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQueryUI</a>. So far, it's pretty awesome.</li>
				<li>Decided to use the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/accordion/">accordion widget</a> for the updates so this list of updates doesn't get huge.</li>
				<li>I think next I want to keep playing with this accordion widget to try to make a more interactive web-based resume. Could be fun.</li>
				<li>I also want to update the navbar to make it more modern, possibly make it actively follow you as you scroll down the page. And put a big fun image up in the home section to make this page less bland.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Sunday July 26th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Added in <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">bootstrap.css</a>. It's a pretty nice CSS framework that just seemed to make everything look nicer/easier. Seems to make the page load nicer in mobile as well. </li>
				<li>Started playing around with some containers to frame the page better, centered the content so it fits on a 1280px wide resolution screen well. The containers seem to work great so far.</li>
				<li>Started playing with a few style elements, made the font open-sans, playing with colors. I will try to start making the page look nicer soon.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Monday July 13th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Figured out how to create a fixed navbar in CSS. The tutorial I used is <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/css/fixed-navigation-bar/">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Next I want to figure out how to make a dropdown menu for the Projects menu item.</li>
				<li>Ok, so this was easy. I found a code example that I could borrow <a href="http://codepen.io/philhoyt/pen/ujHzd">here</a>. A little too easy. I had to combine the above examples so I could make the menu stay fixed to the top of the screen and play with the style of the menu items to get it to a fixed width and make it look a little better, but I'm happy with the functionality.</li>
				<li>I spoke a little too soon. I had a really hard time centering this on the top of the page. To solve, I had to make a menu div as a container, and center the nav menu inside that container. I tried doing it all in one step but that wasn't really working when I wanted the menu background to expand to 100% of the page width. It's still not perfect as the menu items are a variable width, and I had to give the nav menu a fixed width of 500px which is about the sum of all the current menu items. This can be a little ugly if I decide to add/remove menu items and then have to reset that width. I'll try to clean this up to make the width of the nav a variable that is equal to the sum of its inherent elements.</li>
				<li>After adding that fixed header, it screwed up my anchor links on the page. I had to add a new anchor class to those anchors that offset the page by the height of my fixed nav bar (32px)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Sunday July 12th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>Setup and Amazon EC2 server with a basic LAMP setup (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</li>
				<li>Got the domain name (kevanmah.com) to point to the new EC2 server</li>
				<li>Setup GitHub repository using the Windows GitHub desktop client. One of these days I'll switch over to a mac or some *nix device and get more cozy with Git and command line stuff.</li>
				<li>Imported the <a href="weddingwebsite/">wedding website.</a>
				<li>Created this basic landing page by writing some basic html. Next step, get fancy with some CSS and make this site look nice.
