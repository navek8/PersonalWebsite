		This is the personal webpage of me, Kevan Mah. I'm using this website to brush up on basic web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and product design. I don't have a lot of time to work on this, but I try to complete a manageable chunk every now and then when I have an hour or two to spare.
		<br>
		My SourceCode can be found on <a href="https://github.com/navek8">GitHub</a>.
		<br>
		I'll try to include updates on here as progress is made.

		<h3>Thursday July 30th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			This is what I have done today:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>I didn't accompish much today. I did some quick bug fixes on how the image appears and then scaled down the image size from 1.6MB -> 262KB to help the page load faster. The image quality didn't need to be so high, especially since I have the grey CSS overlay on top of it.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Wednesday July 29th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			This is what I have done today:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>I put in a cool home background of the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. I had no idea how tricky backgrounds could be. I managed to get a cool features in there with some javascript that resizes it to the browser width/height but it's still not exactly how I want it. I can't believe how much time I spent getting a single picture to appear correctly. Hopefully this goes smoother for the next one! For others that are stuck, I used the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_jumbotron_header.asp">boot strap jumbotron</a> background image feature and some tips from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22000754/responsive-bootstrap-jumbotron-background-image">stackoverflow.</a> </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Tuesday July 28th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			This is what I have done today:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Had more fun with jQuery and bootstrap today. I updated the nav menu to make it fixed on the page in the top right and implemented ScrollSpy so that the navbar highlights/follows you around. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_scrollspy.asp">This</a> is a great tutorial for anyone else interested in it.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Monday July 27th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			This is what I have done today:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Started playing around with <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQueryUI</a>. So far, it's pretty awesome.</li>
				<li>Decided to use the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/accordion/">accordion widget</a> for the updates so this list of updates doesn't get huge.</li>
				<li>I think next I want to keep playing with this accordion widget to try to make a more interactive web-based resume. Could be fun.</li>
				<li>I also want to update the navbar to make it more modern, possibly make it actively follow you as you scroll down the page. And put a big fun image up in the home section to make this page less bland.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Sunday July 26th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			It's been a while since I've had a chance to work on this but this is what I have done today:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Added in <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">bootstrap.css</a>. It's a pretty nice CSS framework that just seemed to make everything look nicer/easier. Seems to make the page load nicer in mobile as well. </li>
				<li>Started playing around with some containers to frame the page better, centered the content so it fits on a 1280px wide resolution screen well. The containers seem to work great so far.</li>
				<li>Started playing with a few style elements, made the font open-sans, playing with colors. I will try to start making the page look nicer soon.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Monday July 13th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			This is what I have done today:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Figured out how to create a fixed navbar in CSS. The tutorial I used is <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/css/fixed-navigation-bar/">here</a>.</li>
				<li>Next I want to figure out how to make a dropdown menu for the Projects menu item.</li>
				<li>Ok, so this was easy. I found a code example that I could borrow <a href="http://codepen.io/philhoyt/pen/ujHzd">here</a>. A little too easy. I had to combine the above examples so I could make the menu stay fixed to the top of the screen and play with the style of the menu items to get it to a fixed width and make it look a little better, but I'm happy with the functionality.</li>
				<li>I spoke a little too soon. I had a really hard time centering this on the top of the page. To solve, I had to make a menu div as a container, and center the nav menu inside that container. I tried doing it all in one step but that wasn't really working when I wanted the menu background to expand to 100% of the page width. It's still not perfect as the menu items are a variable width, and I had to give the nav menu a fixed width of 500px which is about the sum of all the current menu items. This can be a little ugly if I decide to add/remove menu items and then have to reset that width. I'll try to clean this up to make the width of the nav a variable that is equal to the sum of its inherent elements.</li>
				<li>After adding that fixed header, it screwed up my anchor links on the page. I had to add a new anchor class to those anchors that offset the page by the height of my fixed nav bar (32px)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h3>Sunday July 12th, 2015</h3>
		<div>
			This is what I have done today:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Setup and Amazon EC2 server with a basic LAMP setup (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</li>
				<li>Got the domain name (kevanmah.com) to point to the new EC2 server</li>
				<li>Setup GitHub repository using the Windows GitHub desktop client. One of these days I'll switch over to a mac or some *nix device and get more cozy with Git and command line stuff.</li>
				<li>Imported the <a href="weddingwebsite/">wedding website.</a>
				<li>Created this basic landing page by writing some basic html. Next step, get fancy with some CSS and make this site look nice.
